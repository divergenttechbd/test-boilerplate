### 1. **Enable Dependency Injection (DI) Support in DTO Validation:**

- NestJS's `ValidationPipe` can be used to enable transformation and validation. By enabling `transform: true`, it will automatically map the incoming request body to the DTO class, leveraging DI (Dependency Injection).
- **Purpose**: Ensures that the DTO is properly instantiated and its validations are automatically applied, making it more flexible for handling different objects.

### 2. **Apply Security Best Practices via Helmet (or others):**

- We’ll use **Helmet** to secure HTTP headers. This helps to protect your app from common security vulnerabilities.
- **Purpose**: Protects against things like clickjacking, XSS, and content sniffing.

### 3. **Apply Gzip Compression for Performance:**

- **Compression** middleware will help compress HTTP responses to reduce bandwidth usage and improve load times.
- **Purpose**: Improves application performance by reducing the size of the response body.

### 4. **Global Exception Filter:**

- We’ll use a custom global exception filter to handle all exceptions in a centralized manner. This filter will format the exceptions uniformly and ensure that no sensitive data is exposed.
- **Purpose**: Makes error handling consistent and secure.

### 5. **Global Logging Interceptor (from logging directory):**

- We'll apply an interceptor for logging the incoming requests and responses. This will allow us to log detailed information about each request, which can help with debugging and monitoring.
- **Purpose**: Provides insights into the behavior of your application and helps you track performance, request volume, and potential issues.

### 6. **Attach Request ID to Every Request:**

- We can generate a unique request ID for each incoming request, either by generating it on the backend or receiving it from the frontend. This ID will help trace requests across systems.
- **Purpose**: Helps with tracking and debugging requests, especially in distributed systems.

### **Explanation of the Changes:**

1. **Global Validation Pipe**:
   - The **`ValidationPipe`** is used with `transform: true` to ensure that DTOs are transformed and validated correctly. It also strips out properties that don't belong to the DTO and forbids non-whitelisted properties.
   - **Purpose**: This ensures that your data is well-structured and that only validated data is passed into your controllers.

2. **Global Exception Filter**:
   - The **`AllExceptionsFilter`** is applied globally to handle all exceptions in a consistent manner. This filter can be customized to ensure that detailed error messages (without exposing sensitive data) are returned to the client.
   - **Purpose**: Provides consistent and secure error handling across the application.

3. **Logging Interceptor**:
   - The **`LoggingInterceptor`** is used to log all incoming requests and outgoing responses, which is helpful for debugging and auditing.
   - **Purpose**: Provides traceability and visibility into the behavior of your application.

4. **Security Best Practices with Helmet**:
   - **Helmet** is used to secure HTTP headers, which helps prevent a variety of attacks (e.g., XSS, clickjacking).
   - **Purpose**: Adds an additional layer of security to the application by setting proper HTTP headers.

5. **Gzip Compression**:
   - **Compression** middleware is applied to compress HTTP responses. This reduces bandwidth and improves performance, especially when serving large payloads.
   - **Purpose**: Helps improve load times and reduces the size of HTTP responses.

6. **Request ID for Tracking**:
   - A unique **request ID** (`x-request-id`) is attached to every incoming request. If the frontend provides one, it’s used; otherwise, a new UUID is generated.
   - **Purpose**: Helps trace requests across the system, which is especially useful for debugging and monitoring in distributed systems.

7. **Graceful Shutdown**:
   - The application now supports graceful shutdown by listening for the `SIGINT` signal and closing down gracefully.
   - **Purpose**: Ensures that resources are cleaned up properly and that the application doesn't abruptly stop.

### **Next Steps:**
