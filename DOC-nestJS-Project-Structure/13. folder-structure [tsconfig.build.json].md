**2. tsconfig.build.json**

This is the TypeScript configuration file specifically used for building the NestJS application. The tsconfig.build.json file usually contains build-specific configurations, such as excluding test files from the build output.

**Example of tsconfig.build.json**

{

`  `"extends": "./tsconfig.json",

`  `"compilerOptions": {

`    `"outDir": "./dist",

`    `"rootDir": "./src",

`    `"noEmit": false,

`    `"sourceMap": true,

`    `"removeComments": true

`  `},

`  `"include": ["src/\*\*/\*"],

`  `"exclude": ["node\_modules", "test/\*\*/\*.ts"]

}

**Explanation:**

- **extends**: Inherits the settings from the tsconfig.json file. This is useful for reusing common settings.
- **compilerOptions**:
  - **outDir**: Specifies where the compiled JavaScript files will go (dist directory in this case).
  - **rootDir**: The root directory of the source code (src directory).
  - **noEmit**: Prevents the compiler from generating output files (set to false to allow compilation).
  - **sourceMap**: Generates .map files that map the compiled JavaScript code to the TypeScript code for debugging.
  - **removeComments**: Removes comments from the output code to keep the compiled files clean.
- **include**: Specifies which files should be included in the compilation (src/\*\*/\* to include all files in the src directory).
- **exclude**: Specifies which files or directories should be excluded from the compilation (e.g., test/\*\*/\*.ts to exclude test files).
-----
**How It Works:**

- The tsconfig.build.json file allows you to customize how TypeScript should behave during the build process.
- When you run nest build, the NestJS CLI uses this configuration to transpile TypeScript files into JavaScript, and the files are outputted to the dist folder.
