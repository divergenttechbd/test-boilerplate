**📁 .github/ — Root Directory Overview**

This directory **customizes your GitHub repository behavior**, enables **CI/CD**, and defines how contributors should interact with your project (issues, PRs, security).

-----
**📁 .github/workflows/**

**✅ What It Does:**

Houses **GitHub Actions** — YAML configuration files that define **automated workflows** (build, test, deploy, lint, Docker build, etc.).

**🧠 Why Use It:**

Automates your development lifecycle — like running tests, linting code, deploying to staging/prod after each push/PR.

📦 Add multiple files here for different workflows:

- test.yml – unit/integration testing
- lint.yml – static code analysis
- docker.yml – build Docker image
- deploy.yml – deployment on merge to main
-----
**📁 .github/ISSUE\_TEMPLATE/**

**✅ What It Does:**

Contains templates for **bug reports**, **feature requests**, or **custom issue forms** when someone clicks “New Issue” on GitHub.

**🧠 Why Use It:**

Standardizes how team members report bugs and request features, making triaging easier.

**📘 Example: bug\_report.md**

\---

name: 🐞 Bug Report

about: Create a report to help us improve

labels: bug

\---

\### Describe the bug

Other files:

-----
**📄 .github/PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE.md**

**✅ What It Does:**

Auto-populates every new **Pull Request** with a checklist or format — improving PR quality and reducing back-and-forth.

**🧠 Why Use It:**

Ensures PRs are well-documented and follow the process (tests, code style, description, related issues).

**📘 Example:**

\### Summary

\- Describe the changes introduced in this PR.

\### Related Issues

Closes #123

\### Checklist

\- [ ] My code follows the project’s coding style

\- [ ] I’ve added tests where necessary

\- [ ] I’ve updated documentation if needed

📌 GitHub auto-populates this when creating a PR.

-----
**📄 .github/CODEOWNERS**

**✅ What It Does:**

Automatically assigns reviewers for changes to specific files or folders in the repository.

**🧠 Why Use It:**

Enforces accountability and ensures proper team members review certain parts of the code.

**📘 Example:**

\# Frontend team reviews all UI changes

/web/\*\*/\*  @frontend-team

\# DB schema changes go to DB admin

/database/schema.sql  @dba-admin

\# All workflows are reviewed by DevOps

.github/workflows/\*  @devops-team

📌 Works with branch protection rules.

-----
**📄 .github/SECURITY.md *(Optional but recommended)***

**✅ What It Does:**

Tells users how to **responsibly disclose vulnerabilities** and security issues.

**🧠 Why Use It:**

Gives clear process for reporting sensitive bugs (e.g., emails instead of public issues).

**📘 Example:**

\# Security Policy

If you find a security issue or vulnerability:

\- Please DO NOT open a GitHub issue.

\- Instead, contact us at: security@falusaspirations.com

\- We’ll acknowledge within 24 hours.

Thank you for keeping our platform safe!

-----
**📄 .github/FUNDING.yml *(Optional)***

**✅ What It Does:**

Displays **funding links** (like GitHub Sponsors, OpenCollective) on the repo.

**🧠 Why Use It:**

If your project is open-source or community-driven, it helps you collect donations.

**📘 Example:**

github: falus-aspirations

custom: ['https://buymeacoffee.com/falus', 'https://ko-fi.com/falus']

📌 GitHub will show a "Sponsor" button in your repo.
